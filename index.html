HTML ---> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard for
creating web pages, describes the structure of web pages and consists of a
series of elements, these elements tell the browser how to display the content,
also, the elements can be labeled as headers, links, paragraphs, etc.

HTML tags: We create elements by writing tags. Most (but not all) elements
consists of an opening and closing tag, for example:
</p>

<p> I am a paragraph. </p>

The < p > & < /p > are tags, that mark the beginning and the end of a
paragraph.
