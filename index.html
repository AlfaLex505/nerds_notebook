Ok, now, first things first, what is HTML?
<br>
<br>
HTML ---> HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, is the standard for
creating web pages, describes the structure of web pages and consists of a
series of elements, these elements tell the browser how to display the content,
also, the elements can be labeled as headers, links, paragraphs, etc.
<br>
<br>
HTML tags: We create elements by writing tags. Most (but not all) elements
consists of an opening and closing tag, for example:
<br>
<p> I am a paragraph. </p>
<br>
The < p > & < /p > are tags, that mark the beginning and the end of a
paragraph.
