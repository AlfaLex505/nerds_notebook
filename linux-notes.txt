Here's my notes about Linux:

===============================================================================

Disk partition:

There are a couple of commands to check disk partition on a Linux machine: df &
fdisk

- df: This command stands for disk free, and displays information about total
space and available space on a file system. The FileSystem parameter specifies
the name of the device on which the file system resides, the directory on which
the file system is mounted, or the relative path name of a file system. The
most common option to use in this is the "-h" which stands for human readable
output.

The output of the command is presented in columns and rows, the columns are
organized this way: 
FileSystem, TotalSpace, UsedSpace, FreeSpace, UsedPercentage, MountPoint.

- fdisk: This command stands for format disk is a dialog-driven command in Linux
used for creating and manipulating disk partition table, It i used for the view,
create, delete, change, resize, copy and move partitions on hard drive using the
dialog driven interface.

The most common use of this command is the following: "fdisk -l" the "-l" stands
for lists, and the function is to list all the partitions tables in the machine.

Add/extend swap space:

Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If
the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is still full, inactive pages
in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a
small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM.
Swap space is located on the hard drives, which have a slower acces time than
physical memory.

The commands of this lesson are:

- dd: The dd command is a powerful tool used for copying and converting files,
in its simpliest form, the "dd" command requires two primary arguments: "if" &
"of" which stands for "input file" and "output file" respectively, example of
the use of this command is: 

dd if=source.txt of=destination.txt
