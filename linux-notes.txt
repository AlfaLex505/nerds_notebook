Here's my notes about Linux:

===============================================================================

Disk partition:

There are a couple of commands to check disk partition on a Linux machine: df &
fdisk

- df: This command stands for disk free, and displays information about total
space and available space on a file system. The FileSystem parameter specifies
the name of the device on which the file system resides, the directory on which
the file system is mounted, or the relative path name of a file system. The
most common option to use in this is the "-h" which stands for human readable
output.

The output of the command is presented in columns and rows, the columns are
organized this way: 
FileSystem, TotalSpace, UsedSpace, FreeSpace, UsedPercentage, MountPoint.

- fdisk: This command stands for format disk is a dialog-driven command in Linux
used for creating and manipulating disk partition table, It i used for the view,
create, delete, change, resize, copy and move partitions on hard drive using the
dialog driven interface.

The most common use of this command is the following: "fdisk -l" the "-l" stands
for lists, and the function is to list all the partitions tables in the machine.
